# Dictionary Reminder

In the lecture 37 we will be learning more about dictionaries so here is an example of a dictionary in case you forgot about them:

``` search_engines_users = {"google:": 10000000, "bing":127000000, "duck duck go": 120000000} ```

A dictionary is made of pairs of keys and values. For example, the first pair is: ```"google": 10000000 ``` where ```"google"``` is the **key** and ```10000000``` is the value of that key.
