# Installing Jupyter

In the next few sections, we will need to use the Jupyter Notebook as a third-party library. You will need to install Jupyter using one of the commands below:

``` pip3.10 install jupyter```

or 

``` pip3.9 install jupyter```

or 

``` pip3.8 install jupyter```

***Note***: You can change the number after ```pip``` to the correct version for the version of Python you are using. 

# Starting Jupyter

After a successfull installation of Jupyter, you can start a Jupyter notebook by running the command below in the terminal:

```jupyter notebook```

If this command does not work, try the following (based on your OS):

```py -3.10 -m jupyter notebook``` (Windows)

```python3.10 -m jupyter notebook``` (Mac OS) 

If this works, you will see Jupyter Notebook opened in your default internet browser.

## Jupyter in the Cloud

If you don't want to install Jupyter or you cannot install it, you can use Jupyter in the cloud. Google offers a ready-to-use Jupyter notebook here: https://collab.research.google.com/#create=true
