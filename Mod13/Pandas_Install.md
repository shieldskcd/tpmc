# Installing Pandas

Please make sure you have ```pandas``` isntalled. You can install it with ```pip``` from your computer or Atom/VS Code terminal/cmd just like you have installed other third party packages. Please execute one of the commands below to do the installation depending on what version of Python you are using:

``` pip3.10 install pandas```

or 

``` pip3.9 install pandas```

or 

``` pip3.8 install pandas```

etc. 

This will also give you the ability to use IPython shell.
