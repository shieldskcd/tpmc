# Math Operators
In the previous video, we used a basic math operator to do addition
but there are several math operators that can be used. Here are a few
of the most common ones we may use.

## Addition (+)
print (3 + 4)
Output is 7

## Subtraction (-)
print(3 - 4)
Output is -1

## Multiplication (*)
print(3 * 4)
Output is 12

## Division ( / )
print(3 / 4)
Output is 0.75

## Floor Division ( // )
print(9 // 2)
Output is 4

*Explanation* If your room is 9 meters high, you could place **four** 2-meter high wardrobes on top of each other to fill the room. 

## Modulus ( % )
print(9 % 2)
Output is 1

*Explanation* If your room is *nine* meters high, you could place four 2-meter high wardrobes on top of each other. There would be **one** meter of vertical space left.

## Exponentation ** 
print(3 ** 4)
Output is 81

*Explanation* 3 ** 4 is the equivalent of 3 * 3 *3 * 3
