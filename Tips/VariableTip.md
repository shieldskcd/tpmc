# Tips for printing variables

## Tip 1 - Printing Multiple Variables
It is also possible to print out **multiple variables** in one single
print function by using commas between the variables. The last line of the code below contains an example.
``` 
    items = 10
    prince = 2

    total_price = items * price

    # Below we print out three variables

    print(total_price, items, price)
```
Output from this code would be 20, 10, 2

## Tip 2 - Using Comments
You can add comments to your code by starting with a # symbol as shown above. 

The text after the # symbol is ignored by the Python interpreter. The 
comment only serves as information for the programmer. You can write comments above those lines of code for which you feel there should be
some extra clarification to make your code easier to understand.
