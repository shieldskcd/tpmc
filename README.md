# The Python Mega Course with Ardit Sulce from Udemy.com
This will be the repository for the Python Mega Course by Ardit Sulce from the udemy.com site


## Module 1: Welcome
1. We discussed the need for using notes to handle the course.
2. We talked about the structure of the course.

## Module 2: Getting Started with Python
1. We setup the VS Code environment to support Python
2. We confirmed that I currently have PHP installed
3. Created a new project folder to do a basic calculation (3+4). 
4. Use python3 against the my_program.txt and got result of 7
5. Renamed the program to a .py extension to natively run Python
6. Created a new project called Second Project and put a new my_program.py
7. Created a new file that adds 10 and 5 to stay in our Second Project
8. Created a quick math operations cheat sheet (Math_Operators.md) to provide a quick reference for math calls in Python.
9. Reviewed a detailed understanding of what exactly Python is (code launched against the cpython library to convert to machine code)
10. Performed some simple math operators to determine values using print. 

## Module 3: The Basics: Data Types
1. Began discussing variables and why they are important
2. Rebuilt the original first program to use variables instead of just hand keying items. 
3. We discussed instances when you should use the interactive shell versus when we use an actual .py file
4. We discussed using the split screen terminal to have one terminal running just a shell and another that runs the python interpereter.
5. Created a small program to show the different types of variables you can use in Python including string, integer, and float. 
6. Created some commands to use range and turn the items into a list.
7. Used the dir(list) to understand what you can do with any data type.
8. Experimented with data attributes such as string.upper() to convert to upper case. 
9. Began writing code that can be used to find the average of a list of numbers. 
10. Worked with max values in the student_grades list (see maxval.py)
11. Created a script that will calculate the number of times an item appears in a list (see countval.py)
12. Create a script that converts a string value to lower case (see stringlower.py)
13. Updated the list.py file to use a dictionary for grades and calculated the grades by separating the student grades from the names.
14. Create a new file (temps.py) to create a dictionary of float temperature values and print them.
15. Worked on separating out tuples and lists (see tuples.py). A tuple is immutable - meaning you cannot change it. A list, on the other hand is mutable - you can make changes to it. 
16. Created a complex tuple for color codes (see color_tuples.py)
17. Created a complex list of tuples for storing temperature values (see complex_dict.py)
18. Created a Data_types_cheatsheet to help track the different data types.

## Module 4: The Basics: Operations with Data Types
1. Created a new list of temperatures and used the append and remove items to modify lists
2. Created scripts to take list items from one list and insert them into another list as an item.
3. Worked with various list indexes to print slices of data in a list.
4. Worked with negative indexes for list to slice data
5. Used a mixed variable type list to extract strings 
6. Used a mixed variable typle list to extract chained strings of data
7. Created scripts to practice slicing of dictionary data and text data.
8. Created scripts to show the key versus value of dictionary data.
9. Created a script to practice string joins
10. Created multiple cheat sheets for quickly performing data operations. 
11. Created several advanced slices to practice seperating values. 

## Module 5: The Basics: Functions and Conditionals
1. Create the mean calculator function to allow us to create our first function
2. Create the currency converter function
3. Create the square area function
4. Create a function that converts ounces to mililiters
5. Create a function to find mean of values in a list
6. Used function to include an if/else statement for conditional results. 
7. Attempted to create a function for conditionals > Did not seem to work.
8. Used the elif function to test for multiple conditions. 
9. One quiz question tested for Less or Equal
10. One quiz question tested for True and False
11. Created a script to use if elif else loops for different temperatures
12. Create Functionals and Conditionals Cheatsheet.

## Module 6: The Basics: Processing User Input
1. Created a script that will read user input, convert it to a float (for tempearture) and then return the value and result from the function. 
2. Created a script that would take a user's name and create a string message to say Hello to that person's name. 
3. Created a script that would add multiple entries (first name and last name) and put them into a message. 
4. Created another string formatting script to organize a message using the .format(name) style. 
5. Used a function to capture a person's name and display a message. 
6. Used another function to capture a person's name and force the first letter to be capitalized.
7. Create Processing User Input Cheatsheet.

## Module 7: The Basics: Loops
1. Created a series of rounded numbers using the round function.
2. Created a for loop that loops through a series of numbers until there are no more and prints them
3. Created a for loop that prints the individual letters of a word on a line and capitalizes each letter.
4. Created an interative loop that displays all the values in a list of numbers
5. Created a loop that only prints if a number is greater than 50
6. Created a loop that prints only numbers that are integers. 
7. Created a loop that only prints the value if it is an integer AND greater than 50.
8. Created a quick guide to Using a for loop on a function.
9. Created a loop that can iterate through a dictionary and print all items, just keys, or just values
10. Created a guide for string formatting a loop
11. Created an actual script that performs the loop over a dictionary. 
12. Created a script to seperate the values of a name and a phone number. 
13. Created a script to replace the + value in the string value of a dictionary with "00"
14. Created a while loop to check for a user name.
15. Created some new additional loops to iterate until a condition is met. 
16. Used the break and continue options to end a loop.
17. Created the Loop Cheatsheet

## Module 8: Putting the Pieces Together: Building a Program
1. This module will be designed to fill any gaps in the knowledge of a programmer trying to write a program. 
2. Created problem statment description and flowchart in Mod8 folder
3. Created the basic code to run textpro.py. Code will look for interrogative words (how? why? etc.) and capitalize. This is performed through a function called sentence maker.
4. If an interrogative is found, it will add a question mark (?) to the string. Otherwise, it will produce a period at the end of the phrase. 
5. Printed the newly formatted sentence to the screen.
6. Created a while looop that will continue to present the "Say Something" input and accept input until the ```\end``` phrase is entered. 
7. We then call the sentence maker function and tell it to operate against the user_input string to format the sentences correctly.
8. We used the .join function on the items in the string to properly concatenate the items in the list. 
9. Module is complete.

## Module 9: List Comprehensions
1. A list comprehension is similar to a loop but is focused specifically on data in lists. 
2. Created a basic for loop to iterate a list (aka a common method for formatting list items). 
3. Created a list comprehension that generates all the list formatting on the fly without having to dedicate a for loop to the process. 
4. Created a data parser function that will only print values in a list that are numbers.
5. Created another data parser function that will only print values that are not negative numbers.
6. Created a new version of the list comprehension file to allow an else-if function when dealing with more complex lists.  
7. Created a script that replaces non-string values in a list with the number 0. 
8. Created a script that converts string numbers to float and then sums up the values. 
9. Create a cheatsheet for List Comprehension.

## Module 10: More About Functions
1. Learned how to send multiple arguments to a function we create.
2. Created a simple script to accept two arguments (find the area of a triangle). 
3. Create a function that takes two values and combines them together.
4. Created a function to determine the mean of multiple numbers
5. Created a function to calculate averages.

7. Created a function that can accept an indefinite nubmer of keyword arguments
8. Created a function to accept keyword arguments but result in a value of 9.
9. Created a Cheatsheet for functions

## Module 11: File Processing
1. Created a text file with a list of fruits to be read by the Python
2. Wrote a script that creates a variable for the items from fruit.txt so they can be displayed (see read_file.py). **IMPORTANT** You MUST browse to the folder (PMC\Mod11 in this case) where the file is stored before running or you will get an error about the directory not found. 
3. Created a file called bear.txt and wrote a script to read out the file contents (see read_bear.py).
4. Create a script that stores the values of fruits.txt into a variable that can be reprinted as many times as desired. 
5. Created a script that use the "with" option to perform blocks of code with an open file before closing it (see with_script.py)
6. Created a script that allows us to read files from a different path than the original (see file_path.py).
7. Created a script that will write data into a new file as it is input into Python (see write_data.py)
8. Created a script that will extract the first 90 characters of the bear.txt file and prints them. 
9. Created a function to count the first 90 characters in a file. 
10. Create a script that makes a new file called "file.txt" and writes the word "snail" inside it.
11. Create a script that makes a new file called "first.txt" and writes the first 90 characters of the 'bear.txt' file.
12. Create a script that uses the append/Update (a+) operation to read a file while also writing and use the seek(0) to return the file cursor to the zero position.
13. Created a script that takes the data of the 'bear1.txt' file and appends it to the end of 'bear2.txt'
14. Created a script that takes the content of 'data.txt' and reads it in, then prints the content out 3 more times.
15. Create a cheatsheet about file processing. 

## Module 12: Modules
1. Learned how to use the import function to import built in modules in Python. 
2. Used the import to import the time function into a script
3. Created a script that reads the values of the vegetables.txt file every 10 seconds and displays that data until we interrupt the script with Ctrl+C
