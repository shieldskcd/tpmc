# The Python Mega Course with Ardit Sulce from Udemy.com
This will be the repository for the Python Mega Course by Ardit Sulce from the udemy.com site


## Module 1
1. We discussed the need for using notes to handle the course.
2. We talked about the structure of the course.

## Module 2
1. We setup the VS Code environment to support Python
2. We confirmed that I currently have PHP installed
3. Created a new project folder to do a basic calculation (3+4). 
4. Use python3 against the my_program.txt and got result of 7
5. Renamed the program to a .py extension to natively run Python
6. Created a new project called Second Project and put a new my_program.py
7. Created a new file that adds 10 and 5 to stay in our Second Project
8. Created a quick math operations cheat sheet (Math_Operators.md) to provide a quick reference for math calls in Python.
9. Reviewed a detailed understanding of what exactly Python is (code launched against the cpython library to convert to machine code)
10. Performed some simple math operators to determine values using print. 

## Module 3
1. Began discussing variables and why they are important
2. Rebuilt the original first program to use variables instead of just hand keying items. 
3. We discussed instances when you should use the interactive shell versus when we use an actual .py file
4. We discussed using the split screen terminal to have one terminal running just a shell and another that runs the python interpereter.
5. Created a small program to show the different types of variables you can use in Python including string, integer, and float. 
6. Created some commands to use range and turn the items into a list.
7. Used the dir(list) to understand what you can do with any data type.
8. Experimented with data attributes such as string.upper() to convert to upper case. 
9. Began writing code that can be used to find the average of a list of numbers. 
10. Worked with max values in the student_grades list (see maxval.py)
11. Created a script that will calculate the number of times an item appears in a list (see countval.py)
12. Create a script that converts a string value to lower case (see stringlower.py)
