# For Loop Over Function

A for loop can also be used to execute a function multiple times. For example, below we are executing ```celsius_to_kelvin``` three times since there are three items in the iterating list:

```
def celsius_to_kelvin(cels):
    return cels + 273.5

for temperature in [9.1, 8.8, -270.15]:
    print(celsius_to_kelvin(temperature))
```

The output of this would be:

```282.25```
```281.95```
```3.0```

So, in the first iteration ```celsius_to_kelvin(9.1)``` was executed, in the second ```celsius_to_kelvin(8.8) ``` and in the third ```celsius_to_kelvin(-270.15)```.
